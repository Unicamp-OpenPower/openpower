abstract: "Open Source Software is an important economic driving force. Companies are aware of the benefits and are adopting OSS as a strategy, opening their source code. However, fostering an OSS developer community is challenging. Newcomers to OSS projects face many technical and social barriers and commonly drop out before making their first contribution. In this keynote, I will talk about how companies are opening their code, the barriers newcomers face to join OSS projects, and FLOSSCoach, a tool we developed to support newcomers first steps.

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Institute of Computing](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/) at the University of Campinas ([Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br/)). My interests are in the intersection of hardware and software systems, particularly in runtime systems for embedded applications, energy optimizations, and handling of heterogeneity and variability in hardware.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/)) in 2014. During my Ph.D. I worked with [Mani Srivastava](http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/person/show/1) in the Networked and Embedded Systems Lab ([NESL](http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/)) and was funded in part with a [Fulbright](http://fulbright.org/) Fellowship. In the latter part of my time at UCLA I served as Executive Director of the NSF Expedition in [Variability-Aware Software](http://variability.org/). Before joining UCLA I graduated with a BS and MS in Computer Science from the Federal University of Santa Catarina ([UFSC](http://www.ufsc.br/)), where I worked in the Software/Hardware Integration Lab ([LISHA](http://www.lisha.ufsc.br/)).
